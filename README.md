# FlightTracker

### Idea behind this project
*Insert Short bio*


### How to Set this up Locally!

Step one:

The first thing we're going to have to do is set up a Cassandra instance locally! To do this, I found [this](https://github.com/hsgubert/cassandra_migrations/wiki/Preparing-standalone-Cassandra-in-local-machine) very helpful!

To reiterate:
```
$ cassandra -f
```
will start up the database. Now that we have it running, we clone this repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/NicoHinderling/FlightTracker.git
$ cd FlightTracker
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I would recommend using a virtual environment for this, but it's definitely not necessary! 



more to come!
